# Windows autoHotKey scripts

## Arrows

- Remove caps lock, and replace it by a custom fn key
- Caps lock + asdw = arrow keys
- Caps lock + q/e = HOME/END
- Caps lock + h = backspace
- Caps lock + j = ctrl
- Caps lock + k = maj
- Caps lock + l = DEL

> On some pc, pressing Caps lock + j (ctrl) + a (left arrow) does not work as ctrl+leftArrow. 

## Tab Hold-tap
- Tab act as windows key if held, tab otherwise

## Harpoon

Bind key to an application window on the fly for better navigation :
- Windows + shift + [u,i,o,p]: binds the active window to the key (ex: Windows+Shift+u bind current window to u)
- Windows + [u,i,o,p]: focus the bind window. If already focus, minimize it

Place the files in the start up directory : Win+r shell:startup
Install auto hot key V1 or V2. (tab hold/tap does not work on v2)
